# Theme Toggle Fix - Version 2

## Issues Fixed

1. **Theme Toggle Button Visibility**
   - The theme toggle button was not visible in the analysis report view
   - The button was being hidden or covered by other elements

2. **Theme Not Applied Consistently**
   - The theme wasn't being applied to all components
   - The dashboard didn't respect the dark/light mode setting

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Theme Toggle Button Visibility

- Added CSS to ensure the theme toggle button always has a high z-index
- Added position:relative to prevent the button from being hidden
- Added a help tooltip to make the button's purpose clear

```css
/* Make sure theme toggle is always visible */
button[kind="secondary"] {
    z-index: 1000 !important;
    position: relative !important;
}
```

### 2. Theme-Aware Dashboard Components

- Updated the interactive dashboard to check the current theme state
- Added theme-specific colors for all dashboard components:
  - Background colors
  - Text colors
  - Border colors
  - Card backgrounds

```python
# Get the current theme
dark_mode = st.session_state.get('dark_mode', False)

# Set theme-based colors
bg_color = "#111827" if dark_mode else "#FFFFFF"
text_color = "#F9FAFB" if dark_mode else "#111827"
card_bg = "#1F2937" if dark_mode else "#FFFFFF"
border_color = "#374151" if dark_mode else "#E5E7EB"
```

### 3. Global Theme Styles

- Added global theme styles to ensure consistent theming across the app
- Applied theme to the main app container

```css
/* Global theme styles */
.stApp {
    background-color: {bg_color} !important;
    color: {text_color} !important;
}
```

### 4. Theme-Aware Expandable Sections

- Updated the expandable sections to respect the theme
- Added theme-specific styles for expanders

```css
/* Theme-specific styles for expanders */
.st-emotion-cache-1gulkj5 {
    background-color: {card_bg} !important;
    color: {text_color} !important;
    border: 1px solid {border_color} !important;
}
```

### 5. Theme-Aware Tags

- Updated the keyword tags to use theme-specific colors
- Adjusted background opacity and border colors based on theme

## How It Works Now

1. The theme state is initialized at the start of the app
2. Global theme styles are applied to the entire app
3. Each component checks the current theme state and applies appropriate colors
4. The theme toggle button is always visible and properly updates the theme state
5. All components respond to theme changes consistently

This ensures a seamless theme switching experience throughout the application.
